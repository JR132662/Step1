[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-css.svg)](http://forthebadge.com) ## In Js

# Goal of the project
The main goal of the project is to build the website of an marketing agency entirely in react.

# How i build this project
* I first learned to use the [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) library which allows to write Css in Js, I liked a lot this library because It's make the code more readable by giving us freedom to build customs and reusables components with CSS.

* I also learned and import the useful library [react router](https://reactrouter.com/) to display the appropriate information to the user when he click on the links and route related to the components, i like that It's make us believe that the website is not a single one page application and have multiples pages.

* For the design and the main structure of the website i took inspiration from the video of an front-end youtuber name [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A)

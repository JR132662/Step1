[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/uses-css.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)**In Js**

# Project's main goal
The project's aim is to build the website of a marketing agency entirely in react and responsively designed.

## How i built this project
* I first learned to use the [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) library which allows to write Css in Js, I enjoyed this library a lot because It makes the code more readable by giving us freedom to build customs and reusables components with CSS.

* I also learned and imported the very useful library [react router](https://reactrouter.com/) to display the appropriate information to the user when he clicks on the links and routes related to the components, i like that It's making us believe that the website is not a single page application and have multiple pages.

* For the design and the main structure of the website i took inspiration from the video of a front-end youtuber named [Brian Design](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A).

## What's missing in this project
I would have liked to learn to test my app with [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) or [jest](https://jestjs.io/) but It will be for my next react app.

## Launch the project
* You can take a look at the project [here](https://miciweb.github.io/react_marketing-agency-website/).

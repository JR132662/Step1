# Project's main goal
The project's aim is to build the website of a marketing agency entirely in react and responsively designed.

## How i built this project
* I first learned to use the [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) library which allows to write Css in Js, I enjoyed this library a lot because It makes the code more readable by giving us freedom to build customs and reusables components with CSS.

* I also learned and imported the very useful library [react router](https://reactrouter.com/) to display the appropriate information to the user when he clicks on the links and routes related to the components, i like that It's making us believe that the website is not a single page application and have multiple pages.
